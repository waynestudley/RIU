Hi Liam

This is a small project I worked on around a year ago - more of an MVP for a mobile app than a polished product (and there are bugs in it - I left the company half way through the project) - thankfully the API's are still up and running - but buggy! There was little or no unit testing going on with that organisation despite my pleas.

It'll give you an idea of the code styles I use - the designs aren't mine so do ignore that aspect!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`


### Test credentials:
Username: italert@moneyexpert.com

Password: aaaaaaaa

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
